# SarkazSerif

Note that I am not a professional type designer by any means, I'm just a highschooler.

A hypothetical font based on Hypergryph's "Sarkaz" alphabet, which is fully geometrical and contains 29 letters. I have attempted to create a serif version of this alphabet, but in the process of doing so, it has resulted in a starkly different script.
